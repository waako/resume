            <p>Tom really helped us out on a number of occasions by being available at odd hours (including, I think, at midnight on one very stressful Sunday) and we really enjoyed having his friendly face on the team. Good luck Tom hope we can catch up soon! -
              <strong>James Borrodell Brown</strong>
            </p>

            <p>Tom worked on the Drupal theming for a local government site. This had very high requirements in pixel-level precision, browser compatibility, and accessibility. This meant that a very high level of expertise was required and Tom demonstrated that he could consistently deliver. He was highly regarded by colleagues on the delivery team as well as those managing the engagement. I would have no hesitation in hiring Tom again for a Drupal theming role. -
              <strong>Django Beatty</strong>
            </p>

            <p>We engaged Tom to work with us as a themer on a major Drupal project for an international client of the French Capgemini Drupal Factory. Tom put in the long hours required to meet the short deadlines, he proved a valuable resource to the team.The site has since been rolled out in Taiwan and Belgium, and localised versions are soon to be rolled out across the rest of Europe and the Far East. -
              <strong>Simon Elliott</strong>
            </p>

            <p>Tom is an extremely valuable addition to any Drupal team. He works well with others and understands the various issues inherent in the delivery of software. His theming knowledge is beyond compare and due to his deeply embedded status within the Drupal community is a fountain of knowledge, able to bounce ideas around with project managers, product owners and back end developers alike, to come up with the best solution for the task at hand.I would definitely recommend Tom and would work with him again if the opportunity arose. -
              <strong>Tabitha Winter</strong>

            <p>Tom is an enthusiastic and keen web developer who constantly researches and experiments with new technologies and web tools. He has a good design eye and an intelligent approach to web development. -
              <strong>Justin Anderson</strong>
            </p>

            <p>I had the pleasure of briefly working alongside Tom while we completed the Bristol City Council website. He was tasked with ensuring the site&#39;s HTML and CSS was in accordance with the WCAG 2.0 guidelines and a specialist accessibility agency&#39;s regular reviews. He undertook this challenging task and made it appear effortless. I would not hesitate to recommend or work with Tom again. -
